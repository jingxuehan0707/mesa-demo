# Disaster Evacuation Agent-Based Modeling

This project demonstrates the use of the `mesa` and `mesa-geo` libraries for agent-based modeling in the context of disaster evacuation scenarios.

## Overview

Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful simulation technique that models the interactions of individual agents within a system. In this project, we simulate a disaster evacuation scenario where agents represent individuals trying to evacuate from a disaster area.

## Features

- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Using the `mesa` library to create and manage agents.
- **Geospatial Modeling**: Utilizing the `mesa-geo` extension to incorporate geographic information into the simulation.
- **Disaster Evacuation**: Simulating the behavior of agents during a disaster evacuation.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install mesa mesa-geo
